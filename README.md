# Icy Impact

A Unity game where a little fire skull has to avoid falling malicious ice creatures.

### [Play it on itch.io](https://miashore.itch.io/icy-impact)

Welcome to my exploration into Unity. This was created alongside the tutorial made by Blackthornprod and expanded on to include custom assets, sounds, music, and score tracking.

-   Music was created using [Bosca Ceoil](https://boscaceoil.net)
-   All art assets were created in Procreate
-   Creature, collision and "death" sounds were created in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
    The flame sound during idleness and one monster hiss were modified and retrieved from the [Youtube Audio Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/soundeffects?ar=2)

##### P.S. Best on 16:9 ratio screens ❤️
